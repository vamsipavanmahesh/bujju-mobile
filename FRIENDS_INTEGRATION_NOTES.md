- **Pull to Refresh**: Refresh connections list with gesture
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Empty States**: Helpful prompts when no connections exist
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark UI matching iOS design patterns

### Technical Features
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after API operations
- **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when network unavailable
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API calls with token management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with hooks, services, and components

## File Structure
### Core Files
- `types/connections.ts` - Connection data interfaces
- `services/connectionsService.ts` - API calls and business logic
- `hooks/useConnections.ts` - React state management
- `components/ConnectionsManager.tsx` - Complete UI component
- `styles/connectionsScreen.ts` - Component styling

### Configuration
- `config/api.ts` - Added connections endpoints

## API Integration
The app integrates with your Rails backend using these endpoints:

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/connections` - List all connections
- `GET /api/v1/connections/{id}` - Get single connection
- `POST /api/v1/connections` - Create new connection
- `PUT /api/v1/connections/{id}` - Update connection
- `DELETE /api/v1/connections/{id}` - Delete connection

### Request Format
```json
{
  "connection": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "relationship": "colleague"
  }
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "relationship": "colleague",
    "created_at": "2023-12-01T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-12-01T10:00:00.000Z"

- Automatic token refresh and error handling
- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage

## Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Validation errors
- Server errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms

## State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Automatic data refresh on focus
- Clean state management patterns

## UI/UX Features
- Modern iOS-style design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- Accessibility support
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Dark theme throughout

## Testing Status
- ✅ Create connections with all relationship types
- ✅ Read connections list and individual details

- [ ] Import from contacts
- [ ] Connection groups/categories
- [ ] Connection history/notes
- [ ] Profile pictures for connections
- [ ] Test with large numbers of connections

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. **Add new API endpoint** → Update `services/connectionsService.ts`
2. **Add new UI feature** → Extend `components/ConnectionsManager.tsx`
3. **Add new state** → Extend `hooks/useConnections.ts`
4. **Add new types** → Update `types/connections.ts`
5. **Add new styles** → Update `styles/connectionsScreen.ts`

## User Flow
1. **User opens app** → Authenticates with Google
2. **User taps Profile tab** → Views profile information
3. **User taps Connections tab** → Loads connections list from API
4. **User taps + button** → Opens add connection modal
5. **User fills form** → Selects relationship type and saves
6. **User sees new connection** → List updates automatically
7. **User can edit/delete** → Long press or tap action buttons

This integration provides a solid foundation for connections management that can be easily extended with additional features as needed.
